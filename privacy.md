Nexus Serial Terminal (“the app”) is a Bluetooth serial terminal that lets you connect to microcontrollers and other devices using **Bluetooth Classic** and **Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)**.

## 1. Data collection
The app **does not collect, transmit, or sell personal data** to the developer or to third parties.  
The app works **offline** and does not use analytics, advertising SDKs, or remote servers.

## 2. Data processed on device
To provide its core features, the app processes data **locally on your device**, such as:
- Bluetooth device information needed to connect (e.g., device name and identifier/address).
- Text you send and receive through the Bluetooth connection (shown in the terminal).

This data is used **only to display and manage the Bluetooth connection** inside the app.

## 3. Data stored locally (preferences)
The app stores some settings **only on your device** (using Android local storage), for example:
- Language and UI mode (Terminal/Dashboard)
- Send/Receive settings (newline, echo filter, etc.)
- Auto-connect preference
- Last connected device (name and identifier) to speed up reconnection

You can delete this local data by uninstalling the app or by clearing the app’s storage from Android Settings.

## 4. Permissions
The app may request the following permissions:
- **Bluetooth / Nearby devices**: required to scan, connect, and communicate with Bluetooth Classic and BLE devices.
- **Location (if requested on your Android version)**: required by some Android versions to discover nearby Bluetooth devices.  
  The app **does not access, store, or share your GPS location**, and does not use location data for tracking.

## 5. Third-party services
The app does not integrate third-party analytics or advertising services.  
Bluetooth communication happens directly between your phone and the device you choose.

## 6. Children’s privacy
The app is not designed to collect personal information from children. It does not collect personal data.

## 7. Changes to this policy
If this policy changes, the “Last updated” date will be revised.
